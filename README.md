# Dwains Lovelace Theme Community Addons

Welcome to the community addons repository. In this repository you'll find many addons to use inside Dwains Theme.

With Dwains Theme Addons you can extend the theme functionality with addons without changing any of the themes cores code. This way you can always update to the latest version without problems but still add your own views/cards.

There are a few types off addons currently available:

### Rooms Addon
With the **Rooms addon** you can add your own functionality to rooms. You can add a button on a room page which links to a custom page. It's also possible to parse some data in that view. 

### More page addon
With **More page addon** you can add your own pages to Dwains Theme. Let's say you want a page with some statistics or just an extra page with some cards. Then the **More page** addons is the way to go. 

### Dynamic page addon
By default the dynamic page only shows cameras. But not everyone has cameras in their HA setup. Or if you just want to show something else on the cameras page. You can use a **Dynamic page** addon.

### Persons addon
With the **Persons addon** you can add your own cards to a person page. Like for example a map, traveling time to work or home. It's also possible to parse some data in that view. 

### House information addon
With **House information addon** you can add own cards to the global house information page. Like for example an calendar, traveling time to work or home. It's also possible to parse some data in that view.
